Features of Whatsapp Homescreen :

1) According to me the layout of whatsapp is too user friendly that we never faced any difficulty while using it . It helps us to view things in a very efficient manner.

2) We can see the profile picture and status of everyone quite efficiently.

3) I also like the feature of search button to search our chats.

4) Whatsapp also provide the feature that if we are tagged in some group then it highlights @ sign so that we can figure out that we are tagged in that group no matter if the group is muted .

Suggestions:

1) It will be great if it will also show the names of all the members online in a different section.
